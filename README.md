Query Performance

## Overview

In this project, you’ll investigate how a relational database (PostgreSQL) optimizes query execution and how you, as a user, can further tune performance. You will:

- Load the **Lahman’s Baseball Database** (1871–2020) into PostgreSQL  
- Analyze the effect of indexes, joins, aggregates, and query plans  
- Compare execution times and query plans across different SQL formulations  
- Propose and implement optimizations (e.g., new indexes or rewritten queries)

---

## Dataset

We’ll work from the provided PostgreSQL dump of the Lahman’s database. It includes tables such as:

- `batting`, `pitching`, `fielding` – seasonal player statistics  
- `teams`, `teams_franchises` – team‐level records  
- `people` – player personal data  
- `hall_of_fame`, `managers` – additional historical tables
